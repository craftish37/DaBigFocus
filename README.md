Add borderless support for minecraft.
### A method to test if the borderless works
Try use [snipaste](https://www.snipaste.com) to take screenshot, if the screenshot shows exactly what you see in the game, means borderless works. If the screenshot taken is a previous-seen picture, means borderless not works.
